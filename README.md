# Hey Credera!
Thanks for letting me do this code challenge! A few things:

* I spent about an hour on this project
* It's self-hosted at http://caree.codes/credera
* If you have any questions, email me at caree@caree.codes

Hope to talk to you soon!

## Available Gulp Tasks:
* 'gulp' - default task. Will return a special message to Credera.
* 'gulp compile-sass' - Will compile Sass and output to a CSS folder
* 'gulp watch' - My favorite. Will watch your files for changes and automatically compile and deploy.

## Hints
* You may need to perform an npm install or update before using Gulp.
* Don't forget to check the console.
